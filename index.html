        Story<br>
        <br>
        Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. <br>
        Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell <br>
        it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and <br>
        sell it at the highest.<br>
        <br>
        Task<br>
        <br>
        Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.<br>
        <br>
        Examples (Input --> Output)<br>
        [1,2,3,4,5] --> [1,5]<br>
        [2334454,5] --> [5,2334454]<br>
        [1]         --> [1,1]<br>
